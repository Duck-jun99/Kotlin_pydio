# This is an application using [pydio cells].

* The language is kotlin,
The database server using [pydio cell] is configured by installing [termux] on an Arm-based smartphone.
* As long as the [pydio cell] works well, it doesn't matter where you install it.

  - However, if you are curious about installing it on Arm-based smartphones, please contact us.

* The ultimate goal is to load the files in the configured database into this application.

* The above codes are written to study [Kotlin], [REST API], and [Pydio Library].
